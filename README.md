Question 1: Seasonal Revenue Trends
Goal: Identify monthly revenue trends for the year 2011.
Insight: Revenue remains stable for the first 8 months but surges significantly in September, peaking in November. This indicates high seasonality driven by pre-holiday shopping.

Question2: Top Performing Countries
Goal: Identify top 10 countries by revenue (excluding the UK).
Insight: The Netherlands, EIRE (Ireland), Germany, and France are the top revenue-generating markets, indicating a strong product-market fit in Western Europe.

Question 3: High-Value Customers
Goal: Identify the top 10 customers by revenue.
Insight: Revenue is driven by a cluster of high-value clients rather than a single outlier. Retention strategies should focus on these key accounts.

Question 4: Expansion Strategy
Goal: Map global demand by unit volume to identify expansion targets.
Insight: The Netherlands and EIRE show the highest unit sales volume. These regions are recommended for the first phase of international logistics expansion.

Recommendation
Based on the analysis, the company should:
Inventory Planning: Ramp up stock levels in August to prepare for the Q4 sales spike.
Marketing Focus: Concentrate budget on the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, and France.
Expansion: Establish distribution hubs in the Netherlands and Ireland to reduce shipping costs and delivery times.
